# Python-List-with-Examples---A-Beginners-Tutorial

The list is a data structure that is changeable, mutable and can be ordered as a sequence of elements. Each value or element that is inside of a list is described as an item. In list, there can be used multiple data at the same time. 

Moreover, it is a collection of arbitrary objects, somewhat similar to a particular array in many other programming languages but more flexible and great to use.
